# MatchesAnalyzer

The application was written using SPRING.

It consists of 4 data models, a class responsible for mapping a JSON file to a list of objects, a controller, and a service that deals with the list of events.

I used HTML to display the data.

After starting the program, the start page is displayed, where it is explained how paths should be entered in the browser to display individual views.

10 results of matches â€“ localhost:8080/Result

Different number of results of matches - localhost:8080/{number}

Alphabetically names of competitors -  localhost:8080/Competitors
